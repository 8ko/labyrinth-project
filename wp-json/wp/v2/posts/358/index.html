Loudly.<\/p><p>Hamzah groaned and rolled over, squinting at his phone. The glare of his screen told him it was far too early to be up on his day off, but that certainly wasn\u2019t stopping whoever was at the door. He put his phone back down and shut his eyes.<\/p><p>On the other side of the bed, Raziq said, \u201cThere\u2019s someone at the door.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Hamzah answered, refusing to move.<\/p><p>After a pause, Raziq said in a rather pointed tone, \u201cGo see who it is.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d came the easy reply. \u201cI\u2019m dead.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah resisted the urge to punch him; it was too early for violence. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t like Raziq had said anything untrue. Hamzah pushed himself up and turned to his side; Raziq was lying with his back to him, completely still. Only the bones of his neck were visible, and they glowed a faint red in the morning light.<\/p><p>The doorbell rang again.<\/p><p>Hamzah dragged himself the rest of the way out of bed and headed for the door. He peered briefly through the peephole and pulled the door open.<\/p><p>Blinking blearily against the light, Hamzah said, \u201cYes?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that necromancer boy, right? Azman?\u201d<\/p><p>Fully awake now, Hamzah stared at his guest: the small, shivering form of Nek Su, his elderly neighbour from several floors down. \u201cNek Su,\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cOh, it happened so suddenly. She was so well last night, she ate plenty for dinner. She even played with me a little afterwards, tossing that little ball of hers that she loves so much around. Ran all over the apartment after it. I never thought this would happen today, it happened so suddenly.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cNek,\u201d he interrupted, \u201cwhat happened?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my Milly,\u201d she near-wailed. \u201cOh, my poor, darling Milly.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Milly?\u201d Hamzah repeated, as calmly as he could.<\/p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d Nek Su blurted out. \u201cThis morning I woke up on my own and wondered why Milly hadn\u2019t woken me, so I went to check on her and she wasn\u2019t moving. Just lying curled up next to her water bowl, all still and cold.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah paused. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Nek.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cCan you help me? That Taufiq, you know, the lawyer from down the hall said you work with demons, keeps going on and on about how you\u2019re a danger to everyone here, but I\u2019ve never believed it. Never. But can you bring her back?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026a little more complicated than that,\u201d Hamzah started, choosing to ignore the mention of that damned bigot Taufiq, may he trip over his feet today. \u201cWe have to check with her spirit, her body\u2013\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cBut you can do it?\u201d Nek Su seized his arm, her eyes going wide. \u201cYou can bring her back?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cWell, maybe\u2013\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about payment. I\u2019ll pay any fee you have.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just\u2013Anyway I\u2019m not\u2013\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cWhatever you need, I\u2019ll find it.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cNek.\u201d\u00a0<i>Granny,<\/i>\u00a0he wanted to say,\u00a0<i>I\u2019m not working this week. It\u2019s my time off.<\/i><\/p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, her eyes tear-bright, voice wobbling. \u201cNow I have no one left.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah looked again at Nek Su\u2019s lined face, her trembling lip, her normally impeccable hairbun pulled into a loose, wispy ponytail, her hands shaking even as she leaned her weight against her cane for support.<\/p><p>\u201cPlease come in,\u201d Hamzah said.<\/p><p>~~~<\/p><p>Raziq was up and properly cloaked\u2013\u201dLike pulling on your favourite pair of jeans,\u201d Raziq had once said, right before his bones disappeared beneath skin, stitched together from spiritual energy\u2013for company by the time Hamzah showed Nek Su to the living room. Hamzah left him to get Nek Su settled in while he headed for the kitchen. There, he mixed some\u00a0<i>sirap<\/i>\u00a0cordial with water in a jug, topping it off with a squeeze of sliced lemon. Skipping the sugar, he found matching floral-patterned cups, the lightest kind he had, set them all on a tray and headed back to the living area.<\/p><p>Nek Su was still gripping her cane, gaze downcast. There was quiet chatter from the television from the other room; Raziq must have turned it on to help fill the silence. Hamzah appreciated the effort, even though he doubted it brought much comfort.<\/p><p>Raziq excused himself while Hamzah poured their drinks, disappearing into their shared bedroom. As the door shut with a click, Hamzah placed Nek Su\u2019s cup in front of her. \u201cPlease have some.\u201d\u00a0<i>Good for calming the nerves,<\/i>\u00a0he thought to himself.<\/p><p>Nek Su lifted the cup to her lips with trembling fingers, taking several distracted sips before setting her cup back down. \u201cI just noticed the time,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have come and bothered you so early in the day. I know you young lot don\u2019t like to get up until after noon.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah carefully suppressed a wince. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have bothered you, Azman,\u201d she went on. \u201cI\u2019ll leave right away.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d Hamzah said hastily. \u201cI mean, my name is Hamzah, but I\u2019m the necromancer and I\u2019d like to help.\u201d<\/p><p>He saw Nek Su waver, torn.<\/p><p>\u201cI want to help,\u201d he said more firmly.<\/p><p>Nek Su closed her eyes briefly, and straightened a little in her seat. \u201cIt\u2019s about Milly.\u201d<\/p><p>Milly, Nek Su told him, was her beloved feline companion of over eleven years, and had kept Nek Su company long after her husband passed. It was for Milly she got up in the mornings, and Milly who stayed with her all day and all night. Milly, her affectionate, attentive cat whom she had found still and lifeless earlier that morning.<\/p><p>At this point, Nek Su was clutching at tissues. \u201cPlease,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cPlease help me get her back. I can\u2019t go on without her.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah leaned forward in his seat, and met her gaze. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll help you, Nek. We\u2019ll get Milly back.\u201d<\/p><p>After he saw Nek Su safely to the elevator, with firm instructions on how to care for Milly\u2019s body coupled with promises to visit her later that evening, Hamzah returned to his apartment to find Raziq decloaked, bare-boned once more.<\/p><p>Raziq cocked his head to one side, a gesture he had adopted post-death, when Hamzah was still having trouble reading his emotions just from his aura. \u201cAre you heading out?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hamzah said, rummaging through the drawers for his car keys. \u201cNeed to get some stuff from the store.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d Raziq reached past him and snatched up the car keys. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you eat something first though?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, just as his stomach sealed the moment with its opportunistic rumbling. Covering his stomach with an arm, Hamzah shot Raziq a sheepish look.<\/p><p>Raziq\u2019s jaw was hanging open slightly, even though he tried to cover it with his hand, and his hunched shoulders were shaking; Hamzah recognised being laughed at when he saw it.<\/p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible boyfriend,\u201d Hamzah told him.<\/p><p>\u201cFor not letting you leave the house on an empty stomach?\u201d Raziq countered, stalking into the kitchen.<\/p><p>\u201cYet at the same time, a great boyfriend,\u201d he added and followed. \u201cI love you.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Raziq said, coming up from the fridge with two eggs balanced expertly on the bone of his fingers. He shot another look at Hamzah, his aura flaring bright. \u201cYou brought me back, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah grinned back, and reached for the pan.<\/p><p>~~~<\/p><p>After stopping by the store, Raziq insisted on dropping by the supermarket as well. Hamzah carried the basket and followed his lover as Raziq drifted amongst the vegetables, picking things up seemingly at random. Even though Hamzah was the only person who ate nowadays, Raziq still insisted on doing the shopping. His excuse had been that Hamzah would just have gotten whatever was cheapest\u2013which was true\u2013instead of what he actually wanted to eat. Personally, Hamzah figured Raziq missed being able to taste his own cooking, and this was one way of filling that gap. It wasn\u2019t much, but by the time they walked back to the car, Raziq was humming, his-faux lips stretched in a smile. That was enough for Hamzah.<\/p><p>Back at the complex, Raziq gave him a cheery wave as the elevator doors closed, arms loaded with grocery bags. Hamzah chuckled as he turned away, walking down the hallway and scanning the door numbers for Nek Su\u2019s place. He stopped in front of 3A-28 and rang the doorbell. After a long silence, Hamzah lifted his hand to ring the bell again, but just then the door creaked open, revealing Nek Su\u2019s anxious face.<\/p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHamzah. I\u2019m so glad to see you. Please come in.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah followed her into the apartment, the air of a recent death already prickling his skin. The force of it always varied\u2013with the passing of time, the situation of death, the emotions of the deceased as they passed\u2013but Hamzah had always been able to sense it, even back when he was a child. It was one of the reasons he had made this his life\u2019s work, after all; if he was going to notice the presence of the dead no matter where he went, he might as well learn to make use of it.<\/p><p>In this case, the scent wasn\u2019t strong, a mere gentle tugging on his senses; Milly hadn\u2019t died a violent death, but she was lingering in the area, so Hamzah could already feel his hopes rising. The most important requirement for bringing back the dead was convincing them they wanted to come back, and if Milly was already hanging around, Hamzah\u2019s work was halfway done.<\/p><p>Nek Su led him into the kitchen and paused. \u201cShould I\u2013would you like something to drink?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s alright,\u201d he said, gesturing to his bag. \u201cI\u2019ve already prepared some drinks for the both of us. It\u2019s part of the ceremony,\u201d he added at Nek Su\u2019s puzzled look.<\/p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said and hesitated again. \u201cDo you want to see her?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d<\/p><p>Milly\u2019s body was lying next to a still-full water bowl, wrapped loosely in a thin white cloth.<\/p><p>\u201cI did exactly as you told me to,\u201d Nek Su was saying. \u201cWhite cloth only, you said, so I used some pillowcases. And I didn\u2019t move her from where I found her. Like you said.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, putting his backpack down. \u201cThank you, Nek.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cAnd now? What do we do now?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cNow we have to find her spirit,\u201d he said.<\/p><p>Hamzah asked Nek Su for two cups, which she brought over. He unscrewed the cap of his water bottle and poured their drinks. For this part, he had prepared some\u00a0<i>kedondong asam boi<\/i>\u00a0juice to strengthen their spiritual energy\u2013his own, to better find Milly\u2019s spirit, and Nek Su\u2019s, to help Milly find her. He downed his drink easily, and while Nek Su worked her way through her share, he dug out the spray bottle he had packed earlier.\u00a0<i>Next, we clear the air,<\/i>\u00a0he thought to himself, spraying the room liberally with his own mixture of\u00a0<i>serai wangi<\/i>. He could feel Nek Su\u2019s curious gaze, but it was quiet, and Hamzah was grateful for the lack of questions. It was hard to work through all the extra chatter; this way he could concentrate on keeping his breathing even, clearing his thoughts as the world slowly dimmed, going grey.<\/p><p>The soul never strayed too far from the body, not without outside influence. Hamzah knew this, and since Milly\u2019s body was as lifeless as Nek Su herself said, that meant her spirit was somewhere nearby. In the house still, he hoped.<\/p><p>He looked around the house, tracking the residual aura. There were two colours, one he traced to Nek Su, who was carefully setting her cup on the counter. The other, he saw, left a trail from the lovingly wrapped remains of the beloved Milly.<\/p><p>\u201cIs she here?\u201d came Nek Su\u2019s whisper, and even her voice sounded further away.<\/p><p>Hamzah took a moment to process her question. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered, gaze still roaming the house, trying to pinpoint the other end of the green aura. Milly\u2019s spirit had roamed all over the house since that morning, washing the apartment in a soft green glow, making her hard to track.<\/p><p>He began walking, making a slow circuit of first the kitchen, then the living area, all the while searching. He could feel Nek Su following him, her spirit flickering on the edge of his attention, but he pushed that away. Instead, he let his feet guide him, taking him past the empty rooms until he was standing in front of a closed door. On the other side, there was a steady hum of energy tugging on his senses, and he knew he had found her.<\/p><p>\u201cNek,\u201d he asked without turning around, gesturing to the door. \u201cMay I go in?\u201d<\/p><p>She was surprised by the question, Hamzah could feel it. \u201cOf course,\u201d Nek Su said. \u201cIs she\u2026is Milly in there?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he answered, pushing the door open to Nek Su\u2019s bedroom. The room was glowing green, Milly\u2019s aura coating the air in a thick, heavy layer. This was where her spirit had been drawn to, Hamzah knew. The tugging sensation grew, and Hamzah walked further into the room, taking slow, sluggish steps until he reached the bed, the air heavy in his lungs.<\/p><p>Hamzah sank into a crouch and peered under the bed.<\/p><p>Milly was curled up in the shadows, nestled in a bundle of faint orange energy\u2013traces of Nek Su\u2019s own spirit\u2013watching him.<\/p><p>Hamzah shuffled a few steps back and turned to Nek Su. \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d<\/p><p>Nek Su let out a gasp and immediately went to crouch down next to him. Hamzah wanted to tell her not to bother\u2013she she wouldn\u2019t have been able to see Milly anyway, not at this stage\u2013but by then Nek Su was already peering under the bed, her hopeful gaze bleeding into disappointment.<\/p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any\u2013\u201d she stopped, swallowing hard. \u201cIs she really there?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.<\/p><p>Nek Su turned back to the bed, gazing unseeing at Milly.<\/p><p>\u201cMilly?\u201d she called, so, so softly. \u201cMilly, dear. Are you there?\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah heard the answering mewl and said, \u201cShe\u2019s answered you. Can you ask her to come out?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cMilly, if you\u2019re there, please come out. Come and talk to Hamzah? Please?\u201d<\/p><p>It took a few tries, with Nek Su growing more and more desperate. At the end of it, Nek Su sounded close to tears, and maybe that was what finally moved Milly. She crawled out, her wispy green form emerging from the darkness, until she stood by the foot of the bed, glancing between Hamzah and Nek Su.<\/p><p>Hamzah stood up and moved to help Nek Su as she slowly got back to her feet. He led her to the kitchen, Nek Su\u2019s trembling grip on his elbow as they returned to where Milly\u2019s body waited. Hamzah didn\u2019t have to look back to know Milly followed, her heavy presence pressing close on the edges of his mind.<\/p><p>They stood by Milly\u2019s body, Nek Su refusing to sit for even a short rest. Hamzah turned to Milly and waited until he had her attention. \u201cWill you come back, Milly?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cPlease come back, Milly,\u201d Nek Su whispered.<\/p><p>Milly chirruped softly and rubbed against Nek Su\u2019s legs.<\/p><p>Nek Su gasped, staggering slightly into him. \u201cIs that her?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs that Milly?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cOh, Milly,\u201d Nek Su murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re really here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<\/p><p>Another soft meow and Hamzah exhaled. The hard part was over.<\/p><p>~~~<\/p><p>What comes from the earth must go back to the earth, and so they burned Milly\u2019s body to ashes on the rooftop. The smoke rose high into the evening air, the smell of burning flesh was strong, suffocating. Nek Su stood next to him, hacking her way from one coughing fit to another.<\/p><p>\u201cNek,\u201d he tried again, \u201cwon\u2019t you please wait by the door?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she rasped stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m waiting right here with Milly.\u201d<\/p><p>Milly lay curled up on Nek Su\u2019s feet, watching the small pyre burn.<\/p><p>When the small corpse in the flames finally burned away, leaving nothing but bones, Hamzah felt it\u2013the connection between body and earth severed, the debt repaid. He let out a short breath and turned to his side. All eyes were on him, Nek Su\u2019s hopeful gaze, and Milly\u2019s eerie undead stare.<\/p><p>Hamzah knelt by the fire, swept one hand through the now-sated flames, his skin passing unburned. He thought about how often he\u2019d done this, giving the dead a way to stay on with their loved ones; he thought about doing the same thing for Raziq, watching his lover\u2019s body burn in an alley, Raziq\u2019s spirit a mere wisp clinging to his shadow.<\/p><p>\u201cMilly,\u201d he called out. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<\/p><p>Without so much as an answering mewl, Milly got up from her sprawl on Nek Su\u2019s feet and trotted over to him, glancing between him and the flames. When Hamzah gestured again, Milly paused and cast one last look back at Nek Su.<\/p><p>As if sensing Milly\u2019s gaze, Nek Su nodded encouragingly, folding her hands over the top of her cane. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d she said, smiling faintly.<\/p><p>Milly dropped into a crouch, tail swishing almost playfully, and leapt into the flames.<\/p><p>~~~<\/p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d Nek Su said again, her arms wrapped protectively around Milly\u2019s skeletal body, the orange and green glow of their spirits bleeding into each other.<\/p><p>Hamzah smiled at her. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just glad I could help.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cAnd help you did,\u201d she said, pressing a quick kiss to Milly\u2019s cheek, who chirped in return. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s back. My lovely Milly, I\u2019ve missed you so.\u201d<\/p><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https:\/\/shousetsubangbang.com\/2017-10\/in-the-name-of-love-01.jpg\" \/><\/p><p>Hamzah ducked his head to hide his growing smile, his chest light. This was the other part he enjoyed about his job: reuniting loved ones with each other. He finished packing his things and straightened, distracting Nek Su from where she was fondly petting Milly\u2019s head.<\/p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to ask me before I go?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t have anymore questions,\u201d Nek Su answered. \u201cBut are you sure there\u2019s nothing else I need to do? I don\u2019t have to feed her?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cShe won\u2019t need to eat anymore.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cAnd she won\u2019t disappear? Really?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cAs long as she wants to stay, she\u2019ll be here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd from the looks of it, she\u2019s planning to stay for a while.\u201d<\/p><p>Nek Su beamed down at Milly, who leaned up to nuzzle her chin. \u201cAnd her\u2013what did you call it? Her cape?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cHer cloak,\u201d Hamzah corrected. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like her second skin, something she can wear outside if she wants to. Or if you ever have company over.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Nek Su said, nodding. \u201cShe\u2019ll need that.. Can\u2019t keep my poor Milly cooped up inside all day.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back and help her with it in a few days,\u201d Hamzah promised. \u201cIt\u2019s probably better to give Milly some time to get used to her new body.\u201d<\/p><p>Nek Su laughed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not exactly\u00a0<i>new<\/i>\u2013\u201d<\/p><p>Milly leapt out of her arms and made a dash for the bedroom. Nek Su gasped, but before she could try and follow, Milly was already trotting back their way, dragging a large red sweater with her, the edges of it glowing a faint orange.<\/p><p>\u201cMy sweater!\u201d Nek Su exclaimed. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realise it was gone.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah watched as Nek Su reached down slowly, wrapping the sweater around Milly before scooping her back into her arms.<\/p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s always been your favourite, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Nek Su asked, rubbing the back of Milly\u2019s skull, laughter in her voice, tears glistening in her eyes.<\/p><p>Milly purred.<\/p><p>~~~<\/p><p>\u201cA happy ending then,\u201d Raziq said from his sprawl over their couch. \u201cGood for them.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hamzah answered, depositing his bag by the wall. Raziq pulled his legs up, and Hamzah sat down, reaching over to tug at Raziq\u2019s foot. Making a soft, pleased noise, Raziq stretched his legs over Hamzah\u2019s lap. Hamzah ran his hands up and down the bones of Raziq\u2019s leg, felt the chill of Raziq\u2019s presence seep into his skin. \u201cI was worried things might get complicated. I mean, it didn\u2019t sound like it would, but I thought it might.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYou always worry,\u201d Raziq reminded him. \u201cYour best and worst quality.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Hamzah waved a hand at him, and they fell quiet as Raziq returned his attention to the television. From what little Hamzah had caught, the woman was guiding her viewers to a shortened version of her family\u2019s secret recipe for\u00a0<i>rendang,<\/i>\u00a0keeping up an effortless commentary even as she churned the contents of a huge pot.<\/p><p>Leaning back against the couch, Hamzah said, \u201cThanks for coming back.\u201d<\/p><p>That caught Raziq\u2019s attention again. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d he asked.<\/p><p>Hamzah shrugged. \u201cNowhere. I was just\u2013thanks. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. With me.\u201d<\/p><p>Raziq reached out and tugged at his arm, coaxing him down until they were squeezed next to each other on the couch, face-to-face. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in any hurry to leave, Zah,\u201d Raziq said. \u201cThank you for bringing me back.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah couldn\u2019t help it. He laughed. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re being sappy.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cHey, you started it,\u201d Raziq said. \u201cAnd please, you\u2019re the sappier one in this relationship.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cI am\u00a0<i>not.<\/i>\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cSays the guy who cried enough for both of us over my pyre.\u201d<\/p><p>Hamzah punched him in the shoulder, and suffered for it when his knuckles throbbed in protest.<\/p><p>That only made Raziq wrap an arm over Hamzah\u2019s waist, tugging him closer. \u201cSorry, sorry. You know I love you.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cLet me make it up to you?\u201d Raziq asked, rubbing circles against Hamzah\u2019s back.<\/p><p>Hamzah pretended to think it over. \u201cDepends,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI mean it has to be something\u00a0<i>really<\/i>\u00a0good.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Raziq replied, his voice going low.<\/p><p>Hamzah felt the brush of fingers on his stomach and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty abrupt change in tone,\u201d he began.<\/p><p>Then Raziq slipped his hand past the waistband of his pants, pressing firmly against him through the cloth of his boxers, making him gasp.<\/p><p>\u201cAre you complaining?\u201d Raziq asked.<\/p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d<\/p><p>Now it was Raziq\u2019s turn to laugh, the bones of him shaking faintly against Hamzah even as Raziq wrapped his fingers around Hamzah\u2019s cock, his grip firm.<\/p><p>With a sigh, Hamzah let his eyes drop to better focus on the sharp bony press of Raziq\u2019s grip on his cock, his hand as cold as the day he had died. It had been strange at first, for there to be bony joints where there had once been warm skin. The sensation had been jarring enough that Hamzah had worried it would be a problem between them.<\/p><p>Of course, Raziq wasted no time showing him that it didn\u2019t have to be. Now even the biting cold of Raziq\u2019s bones pressed up against him only encouraged Hamzah\u2019s arousal, his cock firming in Raziq\u2019s firm, assured strokes.<\/p><p>Hamzah shifted closer, throwing one leg over Raziq\u2019s hip and bringing their bodies as close as he could. He tucked his head under Raziq\u2019s chin, panting against Raziq\u2019s neck.<\/p><p>\u201cIs this any good?\u201d Raziq asked, all faux-innocent. Hamzah inhaled deeply, ready to reply in the same, uncertain tone\u2013two can play that game\u2013except then Raziq slowed his strokes, letting his touch hesitate instead.<\/p><p>Hamzah muttered under his breath. \u201cJerk.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d he asked, still in the same tone.<\/p><p>\u201cCould be better if you kept\u00a0<i>going.<\/i>\u201d<\/p><p>Raziq chuckled, because he really was a jerk. \u201cSo impatient,\u201d he said, but happily took hold of Hamzah\u2019s cock once more, stroking him faster now.<\/p><p>Hamzah growled, opened his jaw wide and bit down on Raziq\u2019s collarbone.<\/p><p>Raziq yelped, his aura flaring bright enough that Hamzah saw it through his closed eyelids. Hamzah felt a brief surge of satisfaction, before Raziq wrapped his fingers around the base of Hamzah\u2019s cock, and\u00a0<i>squeezed.<\/i>\u00a0Hamzah gasped, all the breath in him lost in one go, but Raziq was relentless; he just tightened his grip, bony fingers digging into vulnerable flesh until Hamzah was shuddering against him, fighting to catch his breath.<\/p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d Hamzah panted.<\/p><p>He felt Raziq shifting, and then the bones of his free hand were sliding along Hamzah\u2019s cock, jerking him off in quick, fierce strokes. Hamzah choked on a whine, clutching at Raziq\u2019s shoulders, thrusting desperately into Raziq\u2019s grip.<\/p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Raziq rasped, heavy and full of intent. \u201cCome on.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d Hamzah gasped. \u201cJust a little\u2013\u201d<\/p><p>Raziq dug one fingertip against the tip of Hamzah\u2019s cock, cold and sharp against his slit.<\/p><p>And Hamzah came all over his hands, shaking apart with the force of it.<\/p><p>Raziq held him through it, slowing his strokes until Hamzah went limp against him, panting heavily. Then he moved his hands away, wrapping one arm around Hamzah\u2019s waist once more.<\/p><p>When Hamzah finally caught his breath, drowsy and sated in Raziq\u2019s bony embrace, Raziq asked, \u201cSo, we good?\u201d<\/p><p>He started to laugh, and yawned instead. \u201cYeah, I think we\u2019re good.\u201d<\/p><p>Raziq pressed his teeth against Hamzah\u2019s temple in a kiss, and Hamzah, already half-asleep, didn\u2019t need to see Raziq\u2019s face to know he was grinning.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4602c3f elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"4602c3f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<style>\/*! elementor - v3.5.5 - 03-02-2022 *\/\n.elementor-widget-image{text-align:center}.elementor-widget-image a{display:inline-block}.elementor-widget-image a img[src$=\".svg\"]{width:48px}.elementor-widget-image img{vertical-align:middle;display:inline-block}<\/style>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/shousetsubangbang.com\/2017-10\/in-the-name-of-love-02.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>in the name of love. by A.S.
